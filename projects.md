# Projects

CMD is where raw hardware meets clean code. Here are some of the coolest things I’ve built:

---

### 🔧 ASM OS (Alternative System for Microcontrollers) *(WIP)*

> A MicroPython-powered OS kernel with a GUI and app system — no host PC required.

- Written 100% in MicroPython
- Touchscreen UI support (ST7789 + XPT2046)
- Built-in apps: terminal, setup, file manager

---

### 📦 PicoDOS

> My take on an MS-DOS-style OS for the RP2040, with blue installer vibes.

- Boot menu, basic shell, FAT-style command structure
- Designed to look and feel like retro 80s software

---

### 🎮 Gamer2040

> A DIY handheld running RP2040 and custom-made games.

- Uses ST7789 display, custom buttons
- Compatible with YouMakeTech games
- Made for friends to actually *play*

---

### 🌐 uPB (MicroPython Browser)

> A MicroPython JSON API-based browser for microcontroller UIs.

- Minimal HTML-like tags, JSON-based rendering
- Can browse simple pages on a local device or LAN

---

### 📊 MPsheet *(WIP)*

> A basic spreadsheet written in MicroPython for touchscreens.

- Supports cell editing, navigation, and values
- Great for school projects or simple data logs
