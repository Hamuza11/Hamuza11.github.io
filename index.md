# Hi, I'm Hamuza 👋  

I'm a young developer experimenting with low-level programming, homebrew consoles, and microcontroller-based operating systems. I love exploring retro computing, embedded systems, and making things that may be completely useless—but help me learn.  

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On  
- **ASM (Alternative System for Microcontrollers)** – A lightweight OS for microcontrollers  
- **DUO2040** – A dual-Pico microcontroller system running PicoDOS with an ASM kernel  
- **PicoGPU** – A graphics project for the Raspberry Pi Pico  
- **NANO WEB** – A web gaming console powered by the Raspberry Pi  
- **YEET OS** – A lightweight Linux distribution for gaming and software compatibility  

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: MicroPython, C, Assembly (30x instruction set), BBC BASIC  
- **Platforms**: Raspberry Pi Pico, STM32, RA4M1, Zephyr, NuttX  
- **Interests**: Emulation, retro computing, operating systems, game development
