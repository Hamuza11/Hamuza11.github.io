## ðŸ’» What is CMD?

**CMD (Cool Micro Designs)** is a Gen Z-powered tech lab focused on microcontrollers, DIY electronics, and operating systems â€” built from scratch, with style.

We're not about corporate bloat, overkill frameworks, or 200 MB "Hello Worlds."  
We're about *raw control*, *tiny binaries*, and *cool ideas that actually run on a Pico*.

From OS kernels in MicroPython to homemade consoles and custom GUIs â€” we make the stuff we wish existed.

## ðŸ”§ What We Build

- **Microcontroller Operating Systems**  
  From `PicoDOS` to `ASM`, CMD crafts lightweight, fast, and unique systems for RP2040 and beyond.

- **Custom Hardware Designs**  
  Game consoles, coding handhelds, and other hacker-friendly gear, designed for fun + learning.

- **Open Source Tools**  
  JSON-based browsers, Python spreadsheets, homebrew launchers â€” all optimized for simplicity.

- **Retro + Terminal Aesthetic**  
  Everything we make has a vibe: command-line feels, pixel fonts, and that old-school hacker energy.

## ðŸ§  Our Mission

> Build the future of micro tech â€” simple, hackable, and fun.

Weâ€™re here to:
- Inspire the next generation of coders and tinkerers
- Challenge bloated software with minimal, functional tools
- Keep learning by building something weird every day

No gatekeeping. No BS. Just cool micro designs.

## ðŸ§’ Made by a Kid. Not Kidding.

CMD is run by **Hamza**, a 12-year-old programming genius from Oldenburg, Germany.  
He's already built operating systems, GPU drivers, and more â€” all before turning 13.

Why? Because tech should be fun again.
