# How I Make and Sell My Handheld Consoles

Making DIY consoles started as a side project, but now I even sell a few to my friends (they mostly play Brawl Stars, but still).

## Hardware

- RP2040 microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico)
- ST7789 240x240 screen
- 4â€“6 tactile buttons
- 3D-printed or cardboard casing (depends on budget)

## Software

- PicoGameBoy-compatible games (YouMakeTech engine)
- Custom menu OS written in MicroPython or C++
- Sometimes use NuttX or Zephyr for fun

## Selling Process

1. Build ~5 units
2. Show them off at school ðŸ˜Ž
3. Sell them with custom games included

Itâ€™s not about the money â€” itâ€™s about making tech *tangible*. If you're a kid who loves code, you should try making one too.
