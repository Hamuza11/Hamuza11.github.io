# About CMD

Welcome to **CMD — Cool Micro Designs**, a tech lab by Hamza, a 12-year-old programming genius from Oldenburg, Germany.

CMD is all about:

- Building **bare-metal operating systems** like ASM OS and PicoDOS
- Designing **custom handheld consoles**
- Developing **Python and MicroPython tools** for real-world microcontrollers
- Making electronics accessible and fun for Gen Z + Gen Alpha devs

## 👨‍💻 Who’s Behind CMD?

Hey, I'm **Hamza** — tech geek, dev, and content creator. I make homebrew consoles, write my own kernels, and experiment with anything embedded or low-level. While other kids play Brawl Stars, I build micro-GUIs.

I started CMD to share my creations with the world, and maybe help other young devs get into microcontroller magic.
